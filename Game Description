Hunt the Wumpus
This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic text-based adventure game Hunt the Wumpus. The objective is simple: navigate through a series of rooms, avoid hazards like bottomless pits and super bats, and hunt the Wumpus before it hunts you.

The game logic is fully built from scratch, with all mechanics implemented using core Python features. The only external library used was: Random.
Used to handle room assignments, hazard placement, and the Wumpus's unpredictable movements, creating a dynamic and replayable experience.

This project focuses on game logic, control flow, and user interactionâ€”making it a great exercise in structuring code and handling various edge cases without the need for heavy libraries or frameworks.
